MapleStory WASM brings the classic MapleStory v83 client to modern web browsers using WebAssembly. The repository contains the WASM client build, the local web services used by the browser runtime, and Docker entrypoints for running the web stack. The client is designed to run with Cosmic server.

### How It Works

1. **WASM Client** - The original C++ MapleStory client is compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten, and `web/server.py` serves the generated JS/WASM bundle to the browser.
2. **WebSocket Proxy** - Browsers cannot make raw TCP connections, so a Python proxy bridges WebSocket connections to Cosmic server over TCP.
3. **LazyFS** - A dynamic file system technology that streams game assets (`.nx` files) on-demand via WebSocket and caches them locally in your browser. Assets are only fetched from the network once, providing native loading times on subsequent loads.
4. **Containerized Tooling** - Docker can be used both for serving the project and as a fallback way to build the WASM client.

## ⚠️ Required Game Assets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **must** provide your own game assets to run this project. We cannot distribute them due to copyright.

### 1. Client Assets (`.nx` files)
Place the `.nx` files into the `assets/` directory at the project root.
- These are the same `.nx` files required by the upstream v83 C++ client codebase.
- **Location:** `maplestory-wasm/assets/*.nx`
- Treat `assets/` as read-only. Do not modify files in this directory.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Client Build

#### Prefer the docker build first:

```bash
./scripts/docker_build_wasm.sh
```

Useful variants:

```
./scripts/docker_build_wasm.sh --debug
./scripts/docker_build_wasm.sh --jobs 4
```

#### If the local Emscripten and CMake toolchain is available, you can use the local build:

```bash
./scripts/build_wasm.sh
```

Useful variants:

```bash
./scripts/build_wasm.sh --debug
./scripts/build_wasm.sh --jobs 4
```

#### Output:

The client build output is written to `build/`.

### Local Deployment

Use local deployment when the toolchain and supporting services are available on the host machine.

Requirements:

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Python** | 3.9+ | Local web services |
| **Emscripten** | 3.1+ | WASM compilation |
| **CMake** | 3.16+ | Build system |

1. Build the client with `./scripts/build_wasm.sh`.
2. Install the local Python dependency:

```bash
pip install -r web/requirements.txt
```

3. Start the web services from the repository root:

```bash
python3 web/server.py
python3 web/ws_proxy.py --ws-port 8080
python3 web/assets_server.py --port 8765 --directory .
```

4. Open **http://localhost:8000**.

The websocket proxy is intended to forward traffic to a running Cosmic server instance.

### Docker Deployment

Use Docker when local deployment is not practical or when you want the containerized stack.

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Docker** | 20.10+ | Includes Docker Compose |

Web stack:

```bash
./scripts/run_all.sh
```

Equivalent direct command:

```bash
./scripts/docker_web_up.sh -d
```

Stop all Docker services:

```bash
./scripts/stop_all.sh
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** after the containers are up.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Web Client Configuration (`web/config.json`)

The `web/config.json` file controls how the browser connects to backend services. If values are missing or `null`, the client will attempt to auto-detect them or fall back to `localhost` defaults.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AssetsServerProtocol` | Protocol for the LazyFS assets WebSocket (`ws` or `wss`). |
| `AssetsServerIP`       | IP/Hostname of the LazyFS Assets Server. |
| `AssetsServerPort`     | Port of the LazyFS Assets Server (defaults to `8765`). |
| `ProxyIP`              | IP/Hostname of the WebSocket Proxy for game traffic. |
| `ProxyPort`            | Port of the WebSocket Proxy (defaults to `8080`). |
| `MapleStoryServerIp`   | IP address of the target Cosmic Server (forwarded by proxy). |
| `MapleStoryServerPort` | Port of the target Cosmic Server (defaults to `8484`). |

### Docker Environment

The `docker-compose.yml` provides sensible defaults. Key environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `IS_DOCKER` | `true` | Enables Docker-specific networking |

## 🔧 Development

### Making Changes

1. Edit files under `src/client/`, `src/nlnx/`, `web/`, `scripts/`, or `docker/`
2. Keep `assets/` unchanged
3. Rebuild the client with `./scripts/build_wasm.sh`
4. If the local build is unavailable, use `./scripts/docker_build_wasm.sh`
5. Re-test the relevant local or Docker workflow you changed

### Build Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `./scripts/build_wasm.sh` | Build WASM client (Release) |
| `./scripts/build_wasm.sh --debug` | Build WASM client with debug symbols |
| `./scripts/build_wasm.sh -j 4` | Build with 4 parallel jobs |
| `./scripts/docker_build_wasm.sh` | Build WASM client in Docker |
| `./scripts/run_all.sh` | Start the Docker web services |
| `./scripts/docker_web_up.sh -d` | Start the Docker web services directly |
| `./scripts/stop_all.sh` | Stop all services |
